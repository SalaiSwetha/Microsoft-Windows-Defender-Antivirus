## **Update Threat Definitions**

Windows Security uses security intelligence, also known as definitions, to identify known threats. These definitions include information about known threats. These definitions are updated automatically, but if you suspect a problem with your system, you should ensure that threat definitions are up-to-date before you run a scan.

1.Under Virus & threat protection updates, select **Check for updates**.

Select the back button to return to the **Virus & threat protection** screen.
